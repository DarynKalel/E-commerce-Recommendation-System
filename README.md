#Overview
This project implements a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes user-item interactions and provides personalized product recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior.

#Background
E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart utilize recommendation systems to enhance user experience and engagement. These systems analyze user behavior, such as product views, purchases, and ratings, to predict and suggest items that users are likely to be interested in. This project focuses on collaborative filtering, specifically item-item collaborative filtering, to generate recommendations.

#Features
Popularity-based recommendation system
Collaborative filtering (Item-Item recommendation)
Model-based collaborative filtering
Association rule mining (not implemented in this project)

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains user interactions with products, including ratings. The data is structured with columns for user ID, product ID, rating, and timestamp (ignored for this exercise). The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and is split into training and test sets for model evaluation.

#Implementation
Popularity Based Recommendation
The popularity-based recommendation system suggests popular items based on trends and high ratings. However, it lacks personalization.

#Collaborative Filtering
Item-Item Recommendation: Utilizes the similarity between items and recommends products similar to those the user has interacted with or rated positively.
Model-Based Collaborative Filtering: Employs machine learning techniques to predict user preferences and recommend items based on historical interactions.

#Usage
To use this recommendation system:

Load the dataset and preprocess it.
Choose the desired recommendation method (popularity-based, collaborative filtering).
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Generate recommendations for users based on their behavior and preferences.
